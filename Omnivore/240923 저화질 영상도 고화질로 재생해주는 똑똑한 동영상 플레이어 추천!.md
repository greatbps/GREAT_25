Due to copyright issues, I can't show moving images, but is it okay if the left screen changes like the right one? If you're interested, please watch the video until the end. Finally, we've reached 100 subscribers! Hello, this is 1e1b from HGH lab.

The program I'm introducing today is **Splash 2.0**. Like **PotPlayer**, **GOM Player**, and **KMP** on Windows programs used to watch videos, the reason I'm introducing Splash is that although the mentioned programs are good, it's a pretty decent program that people may not know about. If you're interested in improving video quality, you may have heard of technologies like **AMD's Fluid Motion** or **NVIDIA's Video Super Resolution**. 

Splash also enhances the screen and smoothly increases the frame rate. While Fluid Motion and Video Super Resolution require specific graphics cards from certain companies, today's introduced Splash works for everyone regardless of the company. No complex settings are required, and it's even free. 

**HGHLAB**, a leading IT YouTuber in Korea, negotiated with **Mirillis** to provide it free to our subscribers. I'm not lying. Mirillis is a video software development company in Poland that has created various commercial video-related software. Splash 2.0 is one of them. Originally a paid program, it became free in 2019\. I don't know why they made the transition, but I assume they thought it would be more advantageous for marketing than selling it. Time flies.

Let's quickly go through the download and usage. You can press the "More" button on the YouTube channel or search for "Splash 2.0" on Google. You can download it from the **Mirillis website**. Click download and download it again. Open the downloaded file and install it. Choose English and click the "Next" button to install. 

Press the **Adjust** button at the bottom of the screen to turn various features on and off. Let me explain each main feature one by one.

**MotionSquared** is a feature that increases the video frame rate to make the screen smoother. For PC videos, which often have 24 frames, it increases it to a maximum of 60 frames. 

**Detail Boost** makes the screen sharper. 

**Light Boost** brightens the screen to make the video more enjoyable. As it calculates video quality in real-time through additional operations, it may slightly burden your PC, but as of 2023, it should run smoothly on most PCs. 

When you switch to the **Audio tab**, you can turn **Audio Boost** on and off. Audio Boost is a spatial sound technology that transforms regular stereo sound into immersive sound. It's a great feature when watching war movies with explosions and flying bullets. 

Let's also check the basic functions of the video player. It supports playlists, so you can watch multiple videos in order. The program doesn't support all languages, but since it's in simple English, users of other languages shouldn't find it difficult. It also displays Korean subtitles well if you prepare them as **SRT files**. Common codecs are mostly supported, so even if you use it as the default video program on Windows, it shouldn't be too inconvenient. However, it's not recommended. It doesn't support **SMI subtitles**.

It's an excellent player that enhances low-quality videos to high resolution and improves audio quality. It's undoubtedly a good player, but if you actually use it, you may feel uncertain. It's effective for animations, but for movies, it's case by case. Scenes with complex color composition may look rough, and human faces or skin may appear unnatural. 

I don't manually confirm and adjust it, but it's a program that processes in real-time through predefined algorithms, so its limitations are clear. That's why I use a different video player as my default and I only use Splash 2.0 for videos where it would be beneficial. 

Now, this program is great but it has one drawback. As mentioned earlier, it doesn't support **SMI subtitles**, but there's no need to worry. These days, there are plenty of friendly websites and programs that convert SMI subtitles to SRT. The site address is in the description. Download the file from the site and move it to the folder with the SMI subtitle file. 

By the way, you don't need to worry about viruses. I've checked it. For those who want to automate the subtitle conversion process, you can follow the blog guide step by step to make SMI files convert to SRT with a click. 

Today's main focus was introducing the Splash program, so I'll skip this part. I use about three different video players on my PC. If the response to this video is good, I'll introduce the other programs as well. If the video was helpful, please subscribe and like. Have a peaceful and relaxing day!
