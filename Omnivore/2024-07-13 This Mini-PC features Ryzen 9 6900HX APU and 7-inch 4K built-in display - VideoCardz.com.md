## Is this a Mini-PC, All-in-One PC, or a laptop?

**Miniproca PC has a unique design for a compact PC.**

Think Mini-PC but with a large 7-inch built-in screen. The screen can be used like in a normal laptop; it has touch input and can serve as a primary screen. This isn’t the same idea as the [Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti](https://videocardz.com/newz/minisforum-announces-atomman-x7-ti-mini-pc-pricing-core-ultra-9-185h-oculink-dual-5gbit-and-touch-screen-starts-at-669-barebone), which uses a tiny 4-inch touch screen solely for widgets and device controls. This screen can actually display Windows and can do so in 4K.

So, what is the Miniproca PC? It’s a Mini-PC (measuring 175 x 137 x 55mm) with a built-in screen that can be used as a primary or secondary monitor. Nearly all marketing materials focus on it being a secondary screen rather than using it as a primary monitor. At that point, one would be better off buying a laptop, which also has a battery.

The design is unusual, but it may find its niche among multi-monitor users. The only issue is the pricing. The PC will go on sale at $699 during its early bird crowdfunding period and will launch at $1,259 through retail. That’s just for the cheapest model, though, with the fully configured version with maximum storage and memory options priced at $1,999\. That’s an absurd price and highly unlikely to be successful.
