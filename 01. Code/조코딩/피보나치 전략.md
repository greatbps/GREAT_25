# Fibonacci Confluence Trading Strategy

## Core Components

### 1. Market Structure Analysis
- Monitor for Change of Character (CHoCH) patterns
  * Bullish CHoCH: When price breaks above a previous high after making a lower low
  * Bearish CHoCH: When price breaks below a previous low after making a higher high

### 2. Fibonacci Retracement Levels
Monitor these key levels for potential support/resistance:
- 0% (Start of move)
- 23.6%
- 38.2%
- 50%
- 61.8%
- 65%
- 78.6%
- 100% (End of move)

### 3. Entry Rules

#### Bullish Entry Conditions:
1. Identify a bullish CHoCH pattern
2. Wait for a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern
3. Price should be near one of the Fibonacci retracement levels
4. Entry on the close of the engulfing candle

#### Bearish Entry Conditions:
1. Identify a bearish CHoCH pattern
2. Wait for a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern
3. Price should be near one of the Fibonacci retracement levels
4. Entry on the close of the engulfing candle

### 4. Risk Management

#### Stop Loss Placement:
- For long positions: Below the most recent swing low
- For short positions: Above the most recent swing high

#### Take Profit Levels:
- First target: Next major Fibonacci level
- Second target: 100% of the Fibonacci move

### 5. Pattern Confirmation Rules

#### Bullish Engulfing Pattern Requirements:
- Must occur in an uptrend or at support
- Second candle must completely engulf the first candle's body
- First candle should be bearish (red/black)
- Second candle should be bullish (green/white)

#### Bearish Engulfing Pattern Requirements:
- Must occur in a downtrend or at resistance
- Second candle must completely engulf the first candle's body
- First candle should be bullish (green/white)
- Second candle should be bearish (red/black)

## Trade Management Guidelines

1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of total capital
   - Position size = (Account Risk) / (Stop Loss Distance)

2. Exit Strategy:
   - Partial profit taking at first target (next Fibonacci level)
   - Trail stop loss to break-even after first target hit
   - Final exit at second target or trailing stop

3. Additional Filters:
   - Avoid trading during major news events
   - Confirm trend direction using higher timeframe
   - Check market volatility - avoid extremely low or high volatility periods

## Strategy Implementation for AI

When analyzing market conditions, the AI should:

1. First identify the overall trend direction
2. Look for CHoCH patterns in the price action
3. Calculate and monitor Fibonacci retracement levels
4. Watch for engulfing patterns at key Fibonacci levels
5. Confirm trade setup with all required conditions
6. Provide specific entry, stop loss, and take profit levels

### Pattern Recognition Priorities:
1. Market Structure (CHoCH) - Highest priority
2. Fibonacci Levels - Secondary confirmation
3. Engulfing Patterns - Final confirmation
